Being There Source Code

Being There is an extremely experimental little work of interactive 
fiction with pictures, about existence and Korea. The source is
free and open, and I welcome any collaboration you can offer!

Contributing Code
-----------------
I would like to make Being There into as seamless an experience of
play and experimentation as possible. To that end I welcome any
code contribution to this project, including but not limited to:

- Bug fixes
- Cleaning up and optimizing code
- Adding descriptions, sensory information, actions, default responses,
  and more. 
- Anything you can think of to make the game more enjoyable and seamless.
